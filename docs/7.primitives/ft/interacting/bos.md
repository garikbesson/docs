## Send tokens

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="Smart Contract" label="Smart Contract">

```js
const tokenContract = "token.v2.ref-finance.near";
Near.call(
  tokenContract,
  "ft_transfer",
  {
    receiver_id: "alice.near",
    amount: "100000000000000000",
  },
  undefined,
  1
);
```

:::info
In order to transfer FTs to another account receiver account have to be registered in the token contract and make storage deposit. User can register their account or another account can do it for them.

How to check storage balance in contract (you can make requests to RPC in order to call view methods of smart contract as well):

```js
const aliceStorageBalance = Near.view(tokenContract, "storage_balance_of", {
  account_id: "alice.near",
});
```

<details>
<summary>Example response</summary>
<p>

It returns `null` if account is not registered.

```json
{
  "available": "0",
  "total": "1250000000000000000000"
}
```

</p>
</details>

How to register another account:

```js
const newAliceStorageBalance = Near.call(
  tokenContract,
  "storage_deposit",
  { account_id: "alice.near" },
  undefined,
  1250000000000000000000
);
```

If you need to register your own account just pass `{}` as arguments to call.

## Swap tokens

We will use [Ref Finance](https://app.ref.finance/) as an AMM contract in this section.

:::warning
Before initiating any actions related with swapping tokens you must have to check that a wallet has a sufficient storage deposit on a token's smart contract. Otherwise, tokens may be stucked in the contract's "owner" account and you will need to solve this issue via Ref Finance support.

How to [deposit funds](#attaching-fts-to-a-call--already-exist-here)

:::

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Attaching FTs to a Call

Natively, only NEAR tokens (â“ƒ) can be attached to a method calls. However, the FT standard enables to attach fungible tokens in a call by using the FT-contract as intermediary. This means that, instead of you attaching tokens directly to the call, you ask the FT-contract to do both a transfer and a method call in your name.

Let's assume that you need to deposit FTs on Ref Finance.

```js
const tokenContract = "token.v2.ref-finance.near";
const result = Near.call(
  tokenContract,
  "ft_transfer_call",
  {
    receiver_id: "v2.ref-finance.near",
    amount: "100000000000000000",
    msg: "",
  },
  300000000000000,
  1
);
```

<details>
<summary>Example response</summary>
<p>

```json
'100000000000000000'
```

</p>
</details>

How it works:

1. You call ft_transfer_call in the FT contract passing: the receiver, a message, and the amount.
2. The FT contract transfers the amount to the receiver.
3. The FT contract calls receiver.ft_on_transfer(sender, msg, amount)
4. The FT contract handles errors in the ft_resolve_transfer callback.
5. The FT contract returns you how much of the attached amount was actually used.

## Creating FT

For creating our own FT we will use [Token Farm](https://tkn.farm/). You can use it from GUI in your browser, but we will look at how to use its smart contracts to create a token.

First of all, you need to calculate how much creating a token will cost you.

And then you can create a token.

```js
Near.call(contract, "create_token", args, 300000000000000, requiredStorageDeposit);
```

</Tabs>

Contract of your token will have an address which looks like `<your_token_ticker>.tkn.near`.

After creating a token you can [send it](#send-tokens) to anyone.
