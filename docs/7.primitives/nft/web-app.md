In order to interact with NFT from your Web App you can request data from various APIs from your app (for example, [Marketplaces API](/primitives/nft/querying/marketplaces)).

Moreover, there are few SDKs you might find useful.

1. [JavaScript API](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-api-js/quick-reference) - the library is also known as ```near-api-js```. Using this library on the client side developer can interact with NEAR blockchain, send tokens, deploy contracts, manage accounts and keys, call smart contract methods, etc.
