The Blockchain Operating System (BOS) simplifies building, deploying and accessing decentralized frontends. As with any frontend, you can request data from various APIs (for example, [Marketplaces API](/primitives/nft/querying/marketplaces)).

But BOS differs from classic web applications by the ability to reuse components created by other developers. It means that you can use or fork and customize any existing widget on BOS.

Some widgets that may be useful:
- [NFT Marketplace by Mintbase](https://near.org/near/widget/ComponentDetailsPage?src=mintbase.near/widget/nft-marketplace) - the component shows the way how to use Mintbase API and build NFT marketplace.

- [NFT Selector](https://near.org/near/widget/ComponentDetailsPage?src=minorityprogrammers.near/widget/NFTSelector) - list of NFTs of the currently logged-in user based on Mintbase API. Also, this components shows the way how to reuse components which were developed by other contributors.

- [NFT Transfer](https://near.org/near/widget/ComponentDetailsPage?src=onboarder.near/widget/NFT-Transfer) - widget allows you to transfer any of your NFTs to any valid address.

- [List to Market](https://near.org/near/widget/ComponentDetailsPage?src=mintbase.near/widget/ListToMarket) - put up user NFTs for sale on Mintbase Market.

- [NFT Holders](https://near.org/near/widget/ComponentDetailsPage?src=hack.near/widget/verified.holders) - list of the NFT collection holders based on data from NFT contract.
