Indexers handle [NFT events](https://nomicon.io/Standards/Tokens/NonFungibleToken/Event) on blockchain in order to get updates (such as NFT transfers).

There are various options available here:
- Connect to the secure websocket ([mainnet](/tools/realtime)) 

- Usually every NFT marketplace has their own indexer and you can use their [API](/primitives/nft/querying/marketplaces).

- Run your own NFT indexer following [the tutorial for JavaScript](https://docs.near.org/tutorials/indexer/nft-indexer) or [the tutorial for Python](https://docs.near.org/tutorials/indexer/python-nft-indexer).

- Use the multichain indexer [indexer.xyz](https://www.indexer.xyz/).
